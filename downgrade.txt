* You will need to change your AIIDA_PATH, otherwise it will find the 'newer' config.json and crash

$export AIIDA_PATH=/my/new/path

* vscode can be rather stupid in selecting the virtualenv, you may find your original config.json overwritten
  if that happens, go into $AIIDA_PATH/.aiida, and copy an older config.json over [you can check for one with version=5]

* You will need to have the 'right' versions of certain libraries, e.g., MarkupSafe, Jupyter
  This 'should' be handled by the modified requiremnts file, but errors may occurr..

* Because this is AiiDA < 2.0, you need to run reentry scan after creating a plugin

$reentry scan

* You will then also need to set up jupyter manually (in a way you don't for aiida>2.0)
https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.5/intro/installation.html

Copy the following to <home_folder>/.ipython/profile_default/startup/aiida_magic_register.py
if __name__ == '__main__':

    try:
        import aiida
        del aiida
    except ImportError:
        # AiiDA is not installed in this Python environment
        pass
    else:
        from aiida.tools.ipython.ipython_magics import register_ipython_extension
        register_ipython_extension()

* remove %load_ext aiida, you only need %aiida after writing the code above
